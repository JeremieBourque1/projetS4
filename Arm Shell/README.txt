## Arm Shell

## Description

The arm is divided in two parts. The first part of the arm is the first joint starting from the wall and the second is starting at the elbow joint to the tool.
For each part there is a different shell and each shell will be printed in two pieces that will need to be assembled to the arm. 

## Assembling

For the first shell, each piece of the shell have 3 holes on small beams. In those holes, you must weld an insert (you can find what insert to use in the shell's BOM).
You will then be able to screw the tho parts together around the first joint (BOM for the screws to use). That will protect the cables and avoid fabric to get stuck in the gears.
You will do the same thing for the second shell.

** Use the Solidworks assembly to see how the shells should fit on the arm and where they go on the arm. **
